# Baltimore Orioles Batter Analysis

To optimize player development for the Baltimore Orioles, we will analyze the weaknesses of 
Orioles hitters to identify areas of improvement. 
By providing which pitch types in different areas of the strike-zone have 
low likelihood of contact for each hitter, coaches can better train their players depending on their individual profiles.

By focusing on Orioles players with the most plate appearances and the lowest batting averages, 
we can focus on the most impactful weaknesses in order to best optimize for player development.
